# StarScape
A recent personal project and possibly the final project of CSC112. A small game/utility that draws upon astronomical data from NASA to create a map of the surrounding stars and planets, combined with a ship and random events that provide a rogue-like experience.
Uses SimpleJSON for parsing the two JSON files.
